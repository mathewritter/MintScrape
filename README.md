# MintScrape
MintScrape is a screen scraping console application for Mint.com with the ability to write Mint.com account balances on an Excel spreadsheet.  MintScrape works by matching the account name column's values to an account's nickname in Mint.com.

Go to the app.config file to configure user credentials, spreadsheet column numbers, sheet name and file path.  Download the slowcheetah plugin for Visual Studio in order to use config transforms for the app.config file.
